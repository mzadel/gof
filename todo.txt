publish
just include the main script and call it gofci; have all the other functionality as bash functions
include the documentation and the bash functions in the one file -> so installation is copying it into search path and installing the bash functions
 in documentation, can tell people to season to taste (eg add in values for the different author env variables etc)
 do docs in markdown so you can easily publish an html version as well
maybe convert from rcs into a git tree and publish that as well

include the procedure for converting the file + gof directory into a regular repo (checkin changes && copy .git dir && git checkout)
